# NST_with_self-attention

### Description:
This repo stores the result of my final project for UCSD COGS185 Advanced Machine Learning Methods.

### Project topic: 
My project tries to directly apply the self-attention module on the original neural style transfer algorithm in order to examine its efficacy in style transfer field. The results demonstrate its ability to add stylized details in some generated images compared to the vanilla algorithm. However, further analysis indicates some existing limitations of this approach and concludes about its greater effectiveness in a model-optimization-based setting.
